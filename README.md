# Ethical Attitudes, Test Anxiety, and Need for Social Approval

## Overview
This repository documents an academic research project examining the relationship between attitudes toward general ethical dilemmas and two personality traits: test anxiety and need for social approval. The study explores how non-moral personality traits relate to ethical judgments across a diverse student population, with implications for business ethics, management decision-making, and organizational culture.

## Research Objective
The primary objective of this study is to assess whether individual differences in test anxiety and the need for social approval are associated with variations in responses to general ethical dilemmas. The research contributes to the broader literature linking personality traits to moral attitudes and ethical decision-making in business contexts.

## Research Questions
- Do individuals with differing levels of test anxiety respond differently to ethical dilemmas?
- Is the need for social approval associated with more socially desirable ethical judgments?
- How do demographic factors interact with personality traits in shaping ethical attitudes?

## Methodology
- **Study Design:** Quantitative, correlational research  
- **Sample Size:** 645 undergraduate and graduate business students  
- **Population:** Students across accounting, finance, management, and marketing majors  
- **Data Collection Sites:** Urban and suburban campuses of a large Eastern U.S. university  
- **Measurement Instruments:**
  - Test Anxiety Questionnaire (Mandler & Sarason, 1952)
  - Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1964)
  - Ten general ethical dilemmas adapted from Michael Sandel’s work

## Ethical Dilemmas Examined
The study evaluated participant responses to ten ethical scenarios, including:
- Taxing the wealthy to provide healthcare
- Selling oneself into slavery
- Selling a kidney on the open market
- Racial profiling by police
- Income disparity between professions
- Moral obligations in everyday commercial behavior

Responses were measured using a five-point Likert scale.

## Key Findings
- **Test Anxiety:** Significantly correlated with 2 out of 10 ethical dilemmas
- **Need for Social Approval:** Significantly correlated with 3 out of 10 ethical dilemmas
- Individuals higher in test anxiety and need for social approval tended to express more ethically conservative or socially approved responses in specific scenarios
- Demographic differences (gender, race, country of birth, religion) revealed meaningful variations in ethical attitudes

## Hypothesis Testing
- **Hypothesis 1:** Partially supported  
  - Test anxiety showed limited but statistically significant relationships with select ethical dilemmas
- **Hypothesis 2:** Supported  
  - Need for social approval demonstrated statistically significant relationships with multiple ethical scenarios

## Analytical Techniques
- Pearson correlation analysis
- Descriptive statistics
- Demographic subgroup comparisons
- Hypothesis testing using significance thresholds

## Practical Implications
The findings suggest that ethical attitudes in organizational settings are influenced by non-moral personality traits. Understanding these relationships can help organizations:
- Improve ethical hiring and promotion decisions
- Design ethics training programs that account for personality differences
- Foster long-term competitive advantage through integrity-driven culture
